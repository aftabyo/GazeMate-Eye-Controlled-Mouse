GazeMate: Eye-Controlled Mouse

Description:
GazeMate is a Python-based project that allows users to control their computer's mouse cursor using eye movements. Leveraging the power of computer vision techniques, specifically facial landmark detection through the MediaPipe library, GazeMate accurately tracks the user's gaze direction in real-time. With intuitive calibration and robust detection, users can effortlessly navigate their computer screens, perform clicks, and interact with applications solely through their eye movements.

Features:
- Real-time eye tracking: GazeMate continuously analyzes webcam input to detect and track the user's eye movements.
- Smooth cursor control: The project translates detected eye movements into precise cursor movements, ensuring smooth and responsive control.
- Click simulation: GazeMate intelligently detects certain eye patterns to simulate mouse clicks, enabling hands-free interaction with applications.
- User-friendly interface: With an intuitive setup process and customizable settings, GazeMate provides a seamless user experience for individuals of all skill levels.
- Open-source and extensible: GazeMate's codebase is openly available on GitHub, allowing developers to contribute enhancements, customize functionality, and adapt the project to different use cases.

Experience the convenience and innovation of hands-free computing with GazeMate: the future of human-computer interaction is at your fingertips, or rather, at your gaze.
